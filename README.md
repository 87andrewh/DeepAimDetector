# DeepAimDetector

### Introduction
We classify individual bullets impacts as assisted by an aimbot or not.
These are highly preliminary results.

### Implementation Overview
Data is pasrsed from 64 hz SourceTV demos, sampled at 32 hz.  
Primary features are view anlge deltas, and the relative angular position of targets.
The model is a vanilla LSTM-512.  
All training data (~15,000 data points) are generated by me, using one commercial "legit" aimbot.  

### Results
Test accuracy on data from a different player using the same cheat:

### TODO
- More feature engineering
- Model other cheats
- Get more samples from other people
- Benchmark human detection ability

### Long-term Goals
- Self-supervised representation learning
- Scale
